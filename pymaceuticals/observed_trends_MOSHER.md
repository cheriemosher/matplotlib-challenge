Three observable trends based on the data:

1. Capomulin is the only drug that seems to reduce tumor volume and increase mouse
survival.

2. Capomulin also had the lowest number of metastatic sites, suggesting a reduction
in the spread of the cancer to other areas of the body.  However, there was an increase 
in metastatic sites over time.

3. The other two drugs, Ketapril and Infubinol, did not have a discernable difference
from the placebo in tumor growth and mouse survival over time.  Though, Infubinol
reduced the number of metastatic sites as compared to the placebo.
